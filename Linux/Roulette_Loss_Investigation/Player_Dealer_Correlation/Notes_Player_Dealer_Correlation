After looking over the data from March 10th, 12th, and 15th it is easy to see a correlation between the dealer and a specific player.  The Dealer (Billy Jones) worked throughout the casino at multiple games as well as times but only incurred losses when a player named Mylie Schmidt was at the Roulette table.  Every time this player was at the Roulette table along with the Dealer in question (Billy Jones) which was a total of 13 times over 3 days.  The Dealer did not always incur a loss at the Roulette table as seen at 11:00 PM 3/15 while it should be noted that the player in question (Mylie Schmidt) was not a the table.
